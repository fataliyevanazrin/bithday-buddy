## State Management

The state of the list is managed using Reactâ€™s `useState` hook. Initially, the state is set to the data imported from `data.js`. The button allows users to clear the list by resetting the state to an empty array, which automatically updates the UI.

## Usage

When the app starts, you will see the list of people with their name, age, and image.  
The total number of people is displayed at the top.  
There is a button labeled **"Clear List"** that will clear the list when clicked.

## Conclusion

The **Birthday Buddy** app is a simple React project that demonstrates component-based design, state management with `useState`, and how to render lists dynamically. It offers a basic yet practical example for those looking to understand how to manage and manipulate state in a React application. The app can be easily expanded and customized for more complex use cases.
